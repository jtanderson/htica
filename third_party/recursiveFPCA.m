function V = recursiveFPCA(P, X, dampen)
% Fourier PCA by recursive partitioning of the space and picking best
% splits of the subspace. This is dramatically better than naive FPCA.

% This function carries inside it a Bernoulli generative model for the
% data. For release, should strip it out and make it general.

% This only works for n source variables and n signal variables.

% P: matrix of basis vectors
% A: Original mixing matrix we're generating samples from (we're just
%       pretending we know it).
% n: dimensionsality of the signal.
% m: number of saAmples
