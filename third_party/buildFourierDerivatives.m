% X is the dataset (rows of data).
% u is the direction (vector) we're interested in.
% k is maximum number of Fourier derivatives we'd like to compute
% chunkSize is the batch size of our averaging operation. It's very
% expensive to build all the outer product tensors simultaneously, so we do
% it in batches instead.

% M is a cell array of Fourier moment tensors of order 1 to k.

    % for the size of the largest tensor, 2 is because we have to make all

    % want to make everything fit in memory, once is goes to hdd, this
